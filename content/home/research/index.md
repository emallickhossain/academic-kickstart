[Less is More Expensive: Income Differences in Bulk Buying](/files/BulkBuyingInequality.pdf)
  * Media Coverage: [Chicago Booth Review](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2020/article/why-low-income-families-miss-out-bulk-buying)

**Abstract:** Increasing the salience of unit prices can reduce consumption inequality. Using Nielsen data, I show that low-income households forgo savings by not buying in bulk. I estimate that low-income households could save 5\% on groceries if they bought in bulk like high-income households. Using novel data on state-level unit-price regulations and warehouse club entry, I find that cognitive costs, store preferences, liquidity constraints, and storage costs discourage low-income households from bulk buying. Mandating unit price display, a policy adopted by nine states, may reduce cognitive costs, increase the salience of unit prices, and close the ``bulk buying gap'' by 26\%.
